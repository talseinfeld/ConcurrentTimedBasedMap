/**
 * A concrete implementation of {@link AbstractQueueEvictionScheduler} which
 * uses a single thread to manage the automated eviction. The thread waits until
 * the next scheduled eviction time before trying to perform an automated
 * eviction. It is notified appropriately each time an entry is added or removed
 * from the queue to ensure that it will always wake-up at the time of the next
 * scheduled eviction, not sooner or later. If the queue is empty, the thread is
 * waiting until notified when an entry is added. The behavior is similar to
 * that of {@link DelayedTaskEvictionScheduler}, but it is implemented at a
 * lower level, using a specially crafted thread rather than a scheduled
 * executor service.
